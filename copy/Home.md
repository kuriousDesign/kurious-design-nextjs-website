## GAMIFY YOUR SPACE
With as little as a mini-projector and webcam, you can offer a unique and fun customer experience without taking up precious floor space.


## WHAT I DO
what would ya say it is... ya do here.

I'm a mixologist of sound, light and motion. I enjoy ideation and conceptual design, and am best utilized to execute technical aspects of any project. I can take any technology and reach into my bucket of motors and sensors and hardware I've never even played with before to compose. I learn and I yearn to work with other artists to apply traditional art touches. I'm inquistive and curious; learning is the strongest skill I can boast. Like many artists, project authenticity and novelty has meaning. My cocktails are fun and original. Care to taste?

My experience designing/testing/installing custom one-off machines for industrial automation have afforded me good habits and practices, including project managment skills. In the ideation room, I enjoy moonshot ideas as much as anyone! But I also have a broad-enough perspective which allows me to discern between feasible ideas and expensive ones. I think if you propose an idea, you should have a good idea of how it will get executed or at least know what the right set of questions are.

Do you have a bunch of tech in separted areas that you wish could talk to each other for enhanced interaction? I can do that too. I have developed a interactive software stack that allows multiple developers with their own coding styles to play within. As long as the devices are on the same computer network, you can make anything talk to and control something. Room lighting color change triggered by a guest sitting in another room.

I can operate independently and autonomously within your team. I get things done. I ask questions to the right people and inform everyone; I don't believe in circular communication. I find a way to utilize your team to execute the tasks at hand. I don't wait for the phone to ring, I have a proactive communication style. I can handle as little or as much responsibility that you give me. I love what I do and am passionate about delivering an awesome product.


## WHAT I LOVE

I take on projects that are interesting to me. My enthusiasm doesn't depend on how fat my wallet is. You'll find that my services are affordable, but for that reason I can be selective.

Finding a way to mix botany and natural elements with robotics/mechatronics. Augmenting the natural properties of the plants and producing a way to make them play and interact with humans

Gamifying spaces

Sports tech dealing with American Football or Baseball. Tools augment training

Exploring brain-machine interfaces for use as input to interaction system design

Experiential Interior Design

SynthesizedMotion: 

Haunted Houses and Escape Rooms

## VALUABLE SKILLS

Electrical Design and Schematics for 480/240/120 VAC and Low-Voltage DC. Safe electrical design that conforms with NFPA79 and NEC to ensure no fire hazards are created.

System Integration Software - connecting multiple devices, controls, lights, computers, etc. together to work synchronously



## HOW TO INTEGRATE A SYSTEM

Reduce number of communication protocols where possible
Reuseable interfacing that has similar behavior and meaning for it's state (KILLED/INACTIVE/RESETTING/IDLE/RUNNING/ERROR/STOPPING/ABORTING)
Learn new technologies and communication protocols
Scour the documentation and befriend the tech support of new technologies
Put on your problem-solving and troubleshooting hats
Plan for failure of hardware and software
Do some Yoga
