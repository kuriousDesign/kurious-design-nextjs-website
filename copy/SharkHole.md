# FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS
golfer shoots a ball off a ramp into the mouth of a moving shark
must have torso motion and jaw motion
ball must be retained inside mouth if shot is successful
automatic start for shark, no button pushing
should not injure the golfers
able to retain some downward force on the nose of the shark
4ft long by 2ft diameter body
cost effective

# DESIGN NOTES
use of steel tubing was used because we had an in-house welder, added rigidity while maintaining low moment of inertia

challenge was to keep the shark body light enough to ensure motor could be sized so that it could accelerate with reasonable quickness but also not be so powerful that it could cause a pinch hazard for golfer --> focused reduction of weight with analysis/adjusting throughout design phase

able to reduce cost by utilizing a ballscrew carriage as the pivot, rather than purchasing large and expensive bearings/bushings

designed bite of shark to be sprung closed, so that i could control the bite force, the opening of the mouth is the actuated direction. inherently safe design.

profile of mechatronic components and steel chassis must support removal and installation of foam mascot body for maintenance purposes of internal motors and sensors.

utilize stepper motor for cost-effect position/velocity control

slippage between motor coupler and chassis allow human to overpower shark with reasonably low force --> inherently safe design.
