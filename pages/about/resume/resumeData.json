A hybrid, hands-on role between controls, mechanical, and electrical design would be ideal. Aspects of fabrication, prototyping and R&D also strongly desired. Looking for a company that is interested in in advanced control systems design, and more importantly  aligns with my design philosophy and is receptive to outside-the-box ideas;  I enjoy  team-leading and project management, customer interfacing and appreciate mentoring and being mentored; strong interest in bringing in new business and developing new products for a variety of markets, including interactive design and immersive art. Interested in a progressive company culture; very open to traveling and international relocation."
